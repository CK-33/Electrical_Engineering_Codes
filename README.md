# Electrical_Engineering_Codes
This repository contains several mathematical codes in context of Electrical Engineering. The codes are made by myself and produced in MATLAB or Python for mathematical performance. The folders are divided by course area, so: 

 - Control Theory
 - Electronics
 - Photonics
 - Power and Energy
 - Radio Frequency
 - Signal Processing
 - Telecommunication
Each of this directiores have a readme to describe as theory as its way to perform.
